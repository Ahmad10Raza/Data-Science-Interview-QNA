However, the magnitude of the covariance does not provide information about the strength or direction of the relationship.\n",

A negative correlation close to -1 indicates a strong negative linear relationship, meaning that as the number of hours studied increases, the exam score decreases. A correlation close to 0 indicates a weak or no linear relationship between the variables.\n",
