    "\n",
    "1. **Filter Methods**: These methods rank features based on statistical measures and select the top-ranking ones. Examples include Chi-Squared Test, Information Gain, Correlation Coefficient, and Variance Threshold. These methods are usually fast and easy to use, but they don't consider the interactions between features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wrapper Methods**: These methods evaluate subsets of variables which allows, unlike filter approaches, to detect the possible interactions between variables. Examples include Recursive Feature Elimination, Forward Selection, and Backward Elimination. These methods create many models with different subsets of features and select those that produce the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Embedded Methods**: These methods perform feature selection as part of the model construction process. They are usually more efficient than wrapper methods because they don't involve retraining a model from scratch for each subset of features. Examples include LASSO, Ridge Regression, and Decision Trees.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Gradient Descent (GD)**: In standard (or batch) gradient descent, the gradient of the cost function is calculated over the entire training dataset. This means that GD takes a step towards the minima after calculating the error for each instance in the training set. While this can lead to a more accurate and stable convergence, it can be computationally expensive and slow on very large datasets.\n",

This means that SGD takes a step towards the minima after calculating the error for just one instance. This makes SGD faster and capable of handling very large datasets. However, because SGD uses only one instance at a time, its path towards the minima is more noisy (less regular) than the path taken by GD, which can make it harder for SGD to settle at the absolute minimum.\n",

    "1. **Use Standard Gradient Descent when**:\n",
    "   - Your dataset is small to moderately sized. GD can be computationally expensive and slow on very large datasets because it requires computing the gradient over the entire dataset for each step.\n",

    "Several factors can cause Gradient Descent to converge slowly or not converge at all in machine learning algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learning Rate**: If the learning rate is too high, the algorithm might overshoot the minimum and diverge. If the learning rate is too low, the algorithm will take tiny steps towards the minimum and might take a very long time to converge, or get stuck in a shallow local minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Scaling**: If the features are not on a similar scale, Gradient Descent can take a long time to converge. This is because it will oscillate more in the direction of higher magnitude features. Feature scaling (like standardization or normalization) can help speed up convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Non-Convex Cost Function**: Gradient Descent can get stuck in local minima or saddle points if the cost function is not convex. This is a common issue in neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Poor Initialization**: If the parameters are initialized poorly, Gradient Descent might start far from the minimum and take a long time to converge, or get stuck in a poor local minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Numerical Precision**: Due to the limitations of floating-point precision, very large or very small gradients can lead to numerical problems, like underflow or overflow, which can cause the algorithm to fail to converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Vanishing/Exploding Gradients**: In deep neural networks, gradients can become very small (vanish) or very large (explode) as they are backpropagated through the layers, which can cause the algorithm to converge slowly or not at all.\n",
