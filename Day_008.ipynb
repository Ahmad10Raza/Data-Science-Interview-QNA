    "- **ndarray**: An efficient multidimensional array providing fast array-oriented arithmetic operations and flexible broadcasting capabilities.\n",

Many other libraries in the scientific Python ecosystem, such as pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, are built on top of NumPy and rely on its array and mathematical functionality.\n",
