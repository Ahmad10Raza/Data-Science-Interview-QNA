You can have multiple non-clustered indexes on a table.\n",

    "5. **Covering Index** (or Included Index): A covering index includes all the columns needed to process a particular query.

The benefit is that the database can satisfy the query using only the index, without needing to look up rows in the underlying table.\n",

    "Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and eliminates undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies. It involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between the tables. The main aim of normalization is to add, delete, or modify data without causing data inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization is typically done in stages, called normal forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First Normal Form (1NF)**: Each table cell should contain a single value, and each record needs to be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**: If a table has a composite primary key, each non-key column should be a fact about the entire composite key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**: Every non-key column must be dependent on the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**: A version of 3NF where every determinant is a candidate key.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**: A table is in 4NF if it has no multi-valued dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**: A table is in 5NF if it has no join dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of normalization include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Minimizing data redundancy**: Because normalization divides data into separate tables, it minimizes redundancy and reduces the amount of data storage required.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maintaining data integrity**: Normalization ensures that all data in a table is related and that there is only one way to understand the data in the table.\n",

It can lead to more complex queries that require data from several tables, and it can also lead to more database operations as data is inserted, updated, and deleted across multiple tables. In some cases, denormalization might be more appropriate."

    "\n",
    "4. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**: A table is in BCNF if it is in 3NF and for every one of its dependencies X → Y, X is a superkey. A superkey is a set of columns such that the table has at most one row for each combination of values in these columns.\n",

    "Subqueries in SQL can be categorized based on their position in the main query or based on the number of values they return. Here are the various forms of subqueries:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scalar Subquery**: This type of subquery returns a single value. It can be used anywhere in the main query where an expression returning a single value is allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Row Subquery**: This type of subquery returns a single row of one or more columns. It is often used in comparison operations with operators that compare an entire row of data, such as `=` or `<>`.\n",

    "3. **Column Subquery**: This type of subquery returns a single column of one or more rows. It is often used with operators that work on a set of values, such as `IN` or `NOT IN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Table Subquery**: This type of subquery returns a table (i.e., multiple rows and multiple columns). It is often used in the `FROM` clause of a SQL statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on their position in the main query, subqueries can be further categorized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Subqueries in the SELECT clause**: These subqueries are used in the SELECT clause to form a column of the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subqueries in the FROM clause**: These subqueries are used to form a temporary table that can be used in the FROM clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Subqueries in the WHERE clause**: These subqueries are used to filter the rows for the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Subqueries in the HAVING clause**: These subqueries are used to filter the groups in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Correlated Subqueries**: These are a type of subquery where the inner query depends on the outer query for its values. This means that the inner query is executed once for each row processed by the outer query.\n",

    "Each type of subquery is used in different scenarios and can be used to solve complex problems in SQL."
