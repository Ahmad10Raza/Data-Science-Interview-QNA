    "A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. It provides a systematic way to create, retrieve, update, and manage data. A DBMS can provide a view of the data as a collection of tables, a schema, or objects, depending on its type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purposes of a DBMS are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Abstraction**: DBMS provides a level of abstraction to the users by hiding the details of how data is stored, managed, and maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Independence**: It allows the structure of a database to be changed without affecting the programs that access the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficient Data Access**: DBMS utilizes a variety of sophisticated techniques to store and retrieve data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Integrity and Security**: DBMS enforces rules to maintain data integrity and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Administration**: DBMS provides tools to manage, monitor, and control the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Concurrent Access and Crash Recovery**: DBMS allows multiple users to access data concurrently and provides features for crash recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a DBMS is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), which is based on the relational model. In an RDBMS, data is stored in tables, and relationships are formed using primary keys and foreign keys. Examples of RDBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server. These systems are used in a wide range of applications, from small applications like a personal to-do list to large systems like a bank's customer management system."

    "\n",
    "2. **Difficulty Accessing Data**: Retrieving data from a file-based system can be complex and time-consuming, especially when the data is spread across multiple files. A DBMS provides powerful query languages like SQL to make data retrieval easier and more efficient.\n",

    "4. **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**: This is used to manage transactions within a database. TCL commands include COMMIT (to save the transaction changes to the database), ROLLBACK (to undo the transaction changes that haven't been saved to the database), and SAVEPOINT (to create points within groups of transactions in which to ROLLBACK).\n",

The main aim of normalization is to add, delete, or modify fields that can be made to ensure that data dependencies make sense (i.e., data is logically stored). \n",

This can help improve the performance of the database, as it can reduce the need for complex joins and queries.\n",
