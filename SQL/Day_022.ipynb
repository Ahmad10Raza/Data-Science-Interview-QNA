    "\n",
    "1. **Shared Locks (S)**: Shared locks are used for operations that do not change or update data (read-only operations), such as a SELECT statement. Multiple shared locks can be granted on the same data item, allowing multiple transactions to read (select) a resource with shared locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exclusive Locks (X)**: Exclusive locks are used for data modification operations, such as UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT. Only one exclusive lock is allowed on an item, preventing other transactions from accessing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update Locks (U)**: Update locks are a hybrid of shared and exclusive locks. They are used when a transaction is expected to read a row and then modify it (a read followed by a write). The update lock prevents other transactions from acquiring an exclusive lock on the row, thus preventing deadlocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Intent Locks (I)**: Intent locks indicate that SQL Server intends to place locks at a lower level. They are used to prevent other transactions from modifying the higher-level resource in a way that would conflict with the lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Schema Locks (Sch)**: Schema modification (Sch-M) locks are used when a table data definition language (DDL) operation (such as adding a column or dropping a table) is being performed. Schema stability (Sch-S) locks are used when compiling queries to prevent concurrent DDL operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Bulk Update Locks (BU)**: Bulk update locks are used when performing a bulk-copy of data into a table with the TABLOCK hint.\n",
    "\n",

    "Cursors in SQL Server, while useful in certain scenarios, come with several disadvantages and limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance**: Cursors are row-based operations, meaning they retrieve, manipulate, and update rows one at a time. This can be significantly slower than set-based operations that handle multiple rows at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Resource Intensive**: Cursors can be resource-intensive as they require memory to store the result set and additional CPU resources to maintain the state of the cursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complexity**: Cursors add complexity to your SQL code. They require more code to implement and can be harder to read and maintain than set-based operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Locking and Concurrency Issues**: Cursors can lead to locking and concurrency issues. If a cursor holds locks for a long time, it can block other operations and reduce the concurrency in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Forward-Only, Read-Only**: Some types of cursors, like FAST_FORWARD cursors, are forward-only and read-only. This means you can only fetch rows in the forward direction and you can't update the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Not Suitable for Large Result Sets**: Cursors are not suitable for large result sets. They can consume a lot of memory and cause performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Not Always Portable**: Cursor implementations can vary between different SQL platforms. Code using cursors may not be easily portable from one database system to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these disadvantages and limitations, it's generally recommended to use cursors sparingly and to always look for a set-based operation that could achieve the same result more efficiently."
