    "1. **Machine Learning** is a type of artificial intelligence where a computer system is fed raw data and uses that data to learn patterns and make decisions. ML models are built by manually extracting the relevant features from the data and using them to create a model that can make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deep Learning**, on the other hand, is a subset of machine learning that mimics the workings of the human brain in processing data for use in decision making. Deep learning uses artificial neural networks with several layers (hence the term \"deep\") to carry out the process of machine learning. The main advantage of deep learning over machine learning is that it can automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so. It's particularly effective when dealing with large amounts of unstructured data like images, text, or sound.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **L1 Regularization (also known as Lasso regularization)**: The penalty term is the absolute value of the coefficients. This can lead to some coefficients being shrunk to exactly zero, which effectively means that the corresponding feature is excluded from the model. This property makes L1 regularization useful for feature selection in cases where we have a large number of features.\n",

This tends to spread the coefficient values out more evenly and results in a model with smaller coefficients overall, but it doesn't force them to zero. This makes L2 regularization useful when we believe that all features should have some effect on the output.\n",

    "1. **Histogram**: A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable. To construct a histogram, the first step is to \"bin\" the range of values—that is, divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals—and then count how many values fall into each interval. The bins are usually specified as consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of a variable. The plotted values represent the data count or frequency in each bin.\n",

    "2. **Box Plot**: A box plot (or box-and-whisker plot) displays information about the range, the median and the quartiles of the data. The \"box\" in the box plot shows the quartiles of the dataset while the \"whiskers\" extend to show the rest of the distribution, except for points that are determined to be outliers. Box plots can be useful to display differences between populations without making any assumptions of the underlying statistical distribution.\n",
